      "paragraph1": "Goldie XO's story is one of resilience and rhythm. Born prematurely and defying the odds from day one, Goldie grew up with New York City in their veins — its streets, its sounds, and its unstoppable energy. A serious car accident in early adulthood could have ended the journey, but instead it became a turning point: music became the anchor and the escape, and the decks became home.",
      "paragraph2": "Rooted in NYC, Goldie carved a path through the city's underground scene, blending EDM with Latin House and creating a sound that's both intimate and explosive. From basement parties to main stages, the journey has been fueled by a belief that music can heal, connect, and transform.",
      "quote": "The beat doesn't care where you came from. It just wants you to move.",
      "paragraph3": "Today Goldie XO brings that same passion to every set — whether in a packed club, a festival, or behind the mic on the podcast. The beat goes on, and so does the story."
